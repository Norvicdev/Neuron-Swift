# Neuron

## Introduction
Neuron is a swift package I developed to help learn how to make neural networks. It is far from perfect and I am still learning. There is A LOT to learn here and I've just scratched the surface. As of right now this package provides a way to get started in machine learning. It allows for multiple input and outputs as well as customizing the number of nodes in the hidden layer. As of right now you can create ONE hidden layer, this will change in the future. 

#### Disclaimer
This is very much a `BETA` project and to only be used as a learning tool as of now.
